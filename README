This is a fork of eosbandi's i2c-gps-nav, which can be accessed at https://code.google.com/p/i2c-gps-nav

New Features:
* For I2C-GPS, send distance-to-home in meter units. (You need to modify MultiWii for this to work)
* Send GPS info as FrSky telemetry data, so that the i2c-gps board can be used as a standalone GPS-beacon (together with a GPS and a FrSky Telemetry receiver of course)

See config.h for details on how to configure the new features.
